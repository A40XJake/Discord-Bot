Hello this is my Discord Bot for my personal server.
In order to run the project you must run the Bot class. You also need to ethier use an ENV file 
and make a line with a discord token like so, "TOKEN=discordtoken". Or in the Bot class replace the 
TOKEN variable with your discord token for your bot. This is an ongoing project and I plan to add more features 
in the future and upload my bot to cloud so it can be invited to more servers when I have more features available.

TL;DR use the Bot class to run the bot on your local JDE and replace TOKEN in bot with your server Token. This project was made with Java and Maven.
